==Testability of Flash==

FlashWatir works with flash using javascript. Any function you need to call in flash either to change something or to get some values needs to get exposed as ExternalInterface. 

{{{
// functions available for JavaSript call
ExternalInterface.addCallback("getColor", getColor);
ExternalInterface.addCallback("click", changeColor);
ExternalInterface.addCallback("getSquareLabel", getSquareLabel);
ExternalInterface.addCallback("setSquareLabel", setSquareLabel);
}}}

The default methods like play(), percantage loaded, etc. can be called directly on flash. For more info about these methods please refer the flash.rb file in the source.
